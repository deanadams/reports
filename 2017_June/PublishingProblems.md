Issues with current publisher

## History of issues

## Issues still persist

On June 17, 2017, I tried looking at a variety of articles to see how long it would take to check for errors manually, given that errors persist despite them first being reported over six months ago. My strategy was to look at an article or two in an issue, skip forward a few years, repeat. I skimmed the articles for problems, paying particular attention to incorrect info in equations. I also got the PDF for each article to compare with the html version. I used a form to track when I looked at each. Articles were not based on ones that previously had problems. I did 12 articles in 14 minutes. *Systematic Biology* has, according to Web of Science, 1,614 articles, so doing all in this way would have taken 32 hours. (*Systematic Zoology* has 1,461 more -- I haven't checked for any problems with those yet). Of those 12 articles, 2 had issues with subscripts in tables ("23.0a/8b (278)c" and "aAverage bootstrap support" for example) and three had missing equations. I also did a targeted search for an AE problem (Jack Sullivan listed as an author) and found two instances of that of three articles I checked (the remaining one still had caption issues).

This has also affected sites like Google Scholar: look at [Jack Sullivan's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x1d3PxUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page for articles that appear under his name, but where he's not listed as an author -- it's where Oxford has supplied Google with inaccurate authorship info (link to one of the articles, for example, [this one](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=x1d3PxUAAAAJ&citation_for_view=x1d3PxUAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C), and then go to Oxford's [page for it](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/57/4/628/1632197), and compare it to the [PDF version](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/sysbio/57/4/10.1080/10635150802302443/2/57-4-628.pdf?Expires=1497810338&Signature=Y4JNZJ04saWFoYW6TeEzdU6w-56Ayx2CNKTSNLrdq4mZ~Pag3CmVCugx8e8xVPTQ07Za5blETDKYi7TdYs8HoyQZCVWxf3K33p6RrMZ4eQBFpGW2aAb3TZoHK3RAF4oR35uLqBkYEexFSFkOJpUkAx8dYBWFzqh60wgBOUGCZniWbWJs6HzclNTDmP7AzMwzZEp6TlOv5-VOoi3tEXBEyQ1auBsihNHh-4Iaov3g8CsTQZ~1PHqmxGPbgrZBzInRpDFNPO-AA4lIMxcLtnDaCTZDSe5cAqwKd3s4uO-mCir5Gqf6fR0GyDu-~XQ2wEqLiadfPNmRz5CUKAQD5S1WJA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q)). Citations one downloads are also still wrong. [Note, I'm highlighting Jack b/c he was a very active AE over a period where this has happened a lot, and he also pointed this out on FB].
