# SSB Awards Report – June 2017

## Awards Committee
* Awards Director: Tracy Heath (ssb.awards.director@gmail.com)
* Committee member: Emily Jane McTavish
* Committee member: Felipe Zapata

## Overview

This report will provide details on each of the awards managed by the Awards Director and Awards Committee. At the SSB council meeting in January, the council voted to extend the flexibility of the awards budget. This will allow the Awards Committee to increase the number of student awards given and establish some new awards. 

## Action Items
The Awards Committee would like the council to discuss and vote on new awards and minor changes to the student awards. The details for each of these are provided in our proposal.

* Postdoctoral award
* Student travel award
* Extending the eligibility of the GSRA 

## Award Evaluation Procedures

### Google Drive and Jupyter Notebooks

Managing the awards has all been handled via the ssb.awards.director@gmail.com Google account.
I have created Google forms for most of the reviewing and awards management. 
Previously, applicants submitted their materials via email. 
This approach does not scale well as the number of applications grows. It can lead to loss of materials and is an enormous amount of work for those managing the applications. 
Unfortunately, without Google Suite, we cannot collect submitted files (i.e., PDF files) for our application forms and letters of recommendation using Google Forms. 
Because of this, I decided to use Qualtrics for the GSRA. 
Iowa State University has a license with this service that allows for better management of application materials.
This service also makes it simple to restrict the file type submitted (no more Word documents) and associate the file with the applicant's info. 

Ultimately, we anticipate that the number of applications SSB will receive for our various awards will only increase. 
Using an institutional license for application forms is not practical, long term. 
Thus, SSB needs to get a license with Google Suite, Qualtrics, or some other service (unless there is a free form service that allows for file submission). 
Alternatively, it may be worth discussing application management as part of membership management if we are seeking outside services to handle our membership.



## 2017 Mayr Award

This year we received 23 abstracts for the Mayr competition. We sent out 15 abstracts to reviewers after confirming membership and desire to remain in the competition with the applicants. 
We had six volunteer reviewers to evaluate the abstracts, which were blinded by the Awards Committee. 
The reviewers rated each abstract and the top ten were selected as finalists, with all confirming their participation in the symposium at Evolution in Portland.
The talks will be held on June 24, 2017 in the morning sessions at 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM in Ballroom 202. 

**The 2017 finalists are:**

* Ian Brennan, Australian National University
* Laurel Yohe, Stony Brook University
* Haim Ashkenazy, Tel Aviv University
* Douglas Booher, UCLA
* Will Freyman, University of California Berkeley
* Lillian Hancock, Brown University
* Eli Levy Karin, Tel Aviv University
* Andrew Sweet, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
* Milton Tan, Emory University
* ​Rosana Zenil-Ferguson, University of Idaho

### Judging

We expect to get 4-5 judges who will view all 10 talks. They will then meet the same day to select the winner. 
The winner of the Mayr competition will be announced at the SSB Presidential address on Sunday, June 25 by SSB President, Luke Harmon.

## 2018 Mayr Award

Because the joint meetings will be held with ESEB in Montpellier, France, the organizers require submission of a proposal for the Mayr  symposium. 
Tracy Heath and Emily Jane McTavish will be submitting the proposal by the deadline (June 26, 2017). 
By submitting through the Evolution 2018 system, this will allow the organizers to manage the scheduling of the Mayr talks.
It also means that students wishing to compete for the award must submit their abstracts when the call for submitted talks is opened, which will be November 2017 to January 2018. 
The SSB Awards Committee will receive the abstract and solicit reviewers to help choose the top 10 to participate in the symposium. 
According to the Evolution 2018 website, abstracts not selected for the symposium can be given a poster or will be declined. Thus, unlike with previous Mayr competitions, we cannot guarantee an oral presentation will be given to all applicants. 
This is a concern for the Awards Committee and may need discussion to provide the best opportunity for applicants to the Mayr symposium.
Despite these challenges, we think the opportunity to hold the competition in Europe will open the award to many more international students.



## 2017 Graduate Student Research Awards

The GSRAs were advertised via EvolDir, Twitter, and Facebook. 
We received 84 completed applications, which is a very large increase compared to 2016 (52 complete applications). 
Because of the large number of proposals, the Awards Committee sent out 172 requests to members of the systematics community seeking reviewers. 
The response was excellent and we have 58 volunteers, each of whom are reviewing 4-5 applications. 
The reviewers were given until June 30, 2017 to complete their reviews and we will select the awardees by July 15. 
All 84 applicants will receive summaries of the reviewers' comments with the decision on their award. 

## 2017 Mini-ARTS Awards

The 2017 Mini-ARTS competition will be announced in August, with a deadline in November.
