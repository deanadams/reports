2016 ANNUAL REPORT RESERVE FUND TRUSTEES
========================================

### JOEL CRACRAFT, VICKI FUNK, DAVID HILLIS

*Preliminary Report (12/29/16)*

Whereas fiscal year 2015 was a volatile year and the stock market
experienced a downturn, but the 2016 market increased substantially.
This report is preliminary and primarily based, in part, on November
2016 data, but for the total portfolio value, the number reflects the 29
November value of the portfolio I received directly from Morgan Stanley;
final fiscal 2016 numbers will be available in mid- to late-January
2017.

The SSB endowment increased from \$876,488.78 to \$915,252.24, an
increase of \$38,763.46. Some of this is the upswing after the November
election and only time will tell whether it holds. The Trustees will be
conferring with our fund manager, Daniel Montano, in February when we
may have a better picture of the economic outlook. We will update the
Council. We estimate that the Reserve Fund will distribute a 2016 payout
of around \$27,500.

Although we continue to have a high percentage of the portfolio in
equities (\~90%), the portion in mutual funds is very well balanced
vis-Ã -vis income and risk. We all agree that we should continue this
conservative strategy and continue the five-year 4% moving-average
payout. Again, we will update you after our discussions with Montano and
his team.
