# SSB Awards Report – Jan. 6 2017

## Awards Committee
* Awards Director: Tracy Heath (ssb.awards.director@gmail.com)
* Committee member: Emily Jane McTavish
* Committee member: Felipe Zapata

## Overview
In 2016 we gave $40,000 in awards. These included 2 Mayr awardees, 21 Graduate Student Research Awards, and  6 Mini-ARTS Awards. The following report will discuss the three main awards, application procedures used, and future plans of the awards committee. 

## Action Items
* The Awards Committee would like to propose creating an award that is given to postdoctoral researchers. SSB provides amazing support to graduate students, but does not continue to support these students as they transition in their careers. Some possible awards for members at this stage might be:
	* Publisher's Award – like the publisher's award for best student paper but for someone who published their postdoctoral research in *Systematic Biology*.
	* Travel awards – many postdocs do not have independent funding to travel to conferences and must rely on their PIs to support their attendance to the Evolution meeting or SSB meeting. Conferences are critical for researchers at this stage to network, promote their work, attend workshops, meet NSF program officers, etc. Another option would be to allow for this award to support travel to other kinds of career-development opportunities like workshops. 
* Since the 2018 Evolution Meeting is in Montpellier, France, it may be practical to discuss travel awards for graduate students to attend that meeting. 

## Award Evaluation Procedures
At the 2016 Evolution Meetings, the awards committee met with Elizabeth Jockusch and Karen Cranston to discuss alternatives to awards review processes. These included blind and double-blind reviewing. Other members of the SSB community have expressed expressed that they would like to see the review process for the awards (Mini-ARTS, GSRAs, and Mayr Abstracts) change to a double-blind system. The members of the awards committee are receptive to this change, however, the amount of work required to blind the submissions may be too much to manage with our current system. We will discuss these changes before the next round of applications and determine their feasibility.

### Conflicts-of-Interest
All reviewers for the Mini-ARTS proposals, GSRA proposals, Mayr abstracts, and Mayr talks were screened for conflicts of interest prior to being assigned. 

### Google Drive and Jupyter Notebooks
Managing the awards has all been handled via the ssb.awards.director@gmail.com Google account. In the Google Drive, I have created Google Forms for collecting information from applicants and reviewers. I have also written Python programs (using Jupyter notebooks) to compile the proposals, assign reviewers to proposals, and quantitatively score applications. All of this material will be turned over to the next awards director when my term ends. Hopefully they find it useful (and they know/like python). 

## Mini-ARTS Awards
Six awards were made from a pool of 16 submitted proposals toward revisionary taxonomy and systematics. The 2016 awardees are all listed on the [SSB Mini-ARTS Page](http://www.systbio.org/mini-arts-awards.html). 

Our panel of 13 expert reviewers evaluated the proposals based on the following:

1. Do the efforts described in the proposal fit the intended objectives of the Mini-ARTS program?
2. Will the proposed activities effectively address the applicant's stated goals?

The anonymized reviewer responses to the questions above, plus their rating on a scale from poor to excellent and any additional comments were sent to each applicant upon notification of their outcome in the review process. Several applicants (including those who received the award and those who were not awarded) emailed to say that they appreciated the reviewer feedback. 

At the council meeting in June, I proposed to move the date of this award to spread out the workload of reviewing awards and this was approved. So I will be advertising the 2017 Mini-ARTS competition in the summer with a deadline in November. The application process will be changed to an online (Google) form instead of an emailed application package. This will eliminate the onerous workload of compiling applications for reviewers. 

## Mayr Award
The 2016 Mayr Award Competition at the Evolution meeting in Austin featured 10 excellent talks selected from 32 abstract submissions. The applicants submitted their abstract on the registration site for the 2016 Evolution Meeting. Their submissions were sent to me by Howard Rundle and I then sent each applicant an email with a form to confirm their submission. Once their confirmations were sent, I verified their membership status with Jen Boyd. Three of the applicants were not members at the time of registration. Two of those individuals then joined the society because they weren't aware their membership had lapsed. The third non-member elected to withdraw from consideration since they were unaware of what the competition entailed. Abstracts were reviewed by a panel of 6 volunteers, all members of SSB. 

The 2016 finalists were:

* Eric Goolsby -- Likelihood-Based Parameter Estimation for High-Dimensional Phylogenetic Comparative Models: Overcoming the Limitations of 'Distance-Based' Methods
* Lisa Barrow -- Targeted sampling and target capture: Assessing phylogeographic concordance with genome-wide data
* Sean Reilly -- Historical Biogeography of Reptiles and Amphibians from the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia
* Laura Lagomarsino -- The abiotic and biotic drivers of rapid diversification in Andean bellflowers (Campanulaceae)
* Jesus Ballesteros -- When the Leaf Breaks: Unrooted Phylogenetic Orthology (UPhO) for Phylogenomics
* Michael Landis -- Finding space for biogeography in phylogenetic inference
* Luna Luisa Sánchez-Reyes -- Uncovering macroevolutionary diversification dynamics from clade age, species richness and taxonomic structure
* Oscar Vargas -- Drivers of rapid speciation in high Andean Plants (Asteraceae: Diplostephium)
* Laurel Yohe -- Is vomeronasal system evolution in bats is a one-way street?
* Elizabeth Spriggs -- Parallel phylogeographic histories of two Viburnum species complexes revealed with RADseq data

The talks were judged by 4 members of the SSB community. The judges were given a form to complete for each talk that asked them to rate the finalist's presentation on the following criteria:

* Importance/novelty/relevance of the study
* Creativity of the study
* Quality/comprehensiveness of the study
* Potential for long-term impact on the field of systematics
* Is it clear the student has ownership of the study/ideas/etc.?

The judges then met to discuss the outcome of their evaluations and choose the winners. The award winners–Laura Lagomarsino and Michael Landis–are listed on the [SSB Mayr Award](http://www.systbio.org/ernst-mayr-award.html) site. 

The 2017 Mayr Competition will be held at the 2017 Evolution Meetings in Portland, OR. Like last year, interested and eligible individuals will apply for the award competition at the time of registration on the Evolution Meetings website by submitting a 300-word abstract. The procedure for selecting finalists and award winners will follow a similar procedure as last year. We will update the SSB Mayr Award web page to provide accurate information to students interested in applying by the end of January.

## Graduate Student Research Awards
In 2016, we received 52 proposals from students applying to the GSRA competition. From our applicant pool, we awarded 21 students with funds ranging from 1,300 to 1,700 to support the initiation of graduate student research in systematics. The 2016 awardees are listed on the [SSB GSRA website](http://www.systbio.org/graduate-student-research-awards.html). These awards were selected by a 28 excellent volunteer reviewers, all members of the systematics community (an many former awardees of the GSRA). 
 
The reviewers were asked to provide the following feedback to each applicant:

1. Do the proposed activities have the potential to lead to successful preliminary data collection and support the initialization of the applicant’s graduate research?
2. Please provide any additional comments about the merits of the proposal or other constructive feedback for the applicant.

These comments (with all reviewers remaining anonymous), along with a poor-to-excellent rating of the proposal were sent to each applicant upon notification of the outcome of the review process. 

The 2017 GSRA competition will be opened in early February with a deadline of May 31. The proposal submission will be changed to a Google Form instead of an emailed application package. 

## SACNAS 
At the 2016 SACNAS Conference in Long Beach, CA, Tracy Heath, Corrie Moreau, and Felipe Zapata organized a scientific symposium on [(Day and) Night at the Museum: Exploring Research in Ecology and Evolution behind the Scenes of Natural History Museums](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2016/10/21/evolution-ecology-activities-at-the-2016-sacnas-national-conference-stem-diversity-public-understanding/). The scientific symposium was part of a series of events primarily organized by the BEACON Center. SSB contributed funds to support these activities. Overall, the evolution and ecology program at SACNAS is very successful and offers an excellent opportunity to expose young scientists to research in systematics. 

The SACNAS Board of Directors is very interested in working with scientific societies to develop and sponsor awards at the conference. The Awards Committee hopes to present a proposal to the council for a sustainable award at the SACNAS conference in the near future.
