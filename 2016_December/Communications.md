Report of Dec 16, 2016

## Action items for council
*  None

## Facebook

On Facebook we have gone from 1578 to 1747 members over the past 11 months. There has been minimal spam posted to group. Articles get automatically put in the feed, but garner little reaction (a handful of likes). There have been only a few substantive discussions. 

## Twitter

Our Twitter followers has gone from 4289 to 5154 over the past 11 months. We automatically tweet advance access articles, and manually tweet other society news, calls to participate in conferences, and so forth. 

## MailChimp

Following the suggestions of Anne Yoder we have created a MailChimp account to do occassional mass mailings to members. 

## Website

Have kept the main website on Weebly. For the standalone meeting, the organizers used github pages. We may want to move to that for the systbio.org site.

## Voice

We've talked about what the Society's voice should be. I've kept it pretty bland. Staying away from politics, but also not getting into issues much like double blind reviews, article processing charges, etc. We did promote SSB's cosigned [letter](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/06282016.pdf) on climate change (which of course is not controversial among scientists, but is controversial in some political parties in some of our members' countries). 

There's been no time, really, where I have felt that I've been self-censoring on behalf of SSB. However, it might be useful to identify an issue we want to be a leader on so we can push on this and show some of the vigor of the Society.
